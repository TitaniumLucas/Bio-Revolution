# Bio-Revolution
GitHub Repository for the Bio Revolution Factorio mod.

This mod aims to act as an overhaul for Factorio, replacing industry with agriculture. The intention is to allow players to reach for the stars based on advanced biotechnological industry.

## Status
This mod is currently still a work in progress.

## Planned/Potential Features
- Three factory phases
    - Artisan: Slow buildings with low throughput but low requirements
    - Industrial: Large buildings with high throughput but high infrastucture costs
    - Interplanetary: Recipes start requiring colonies on other planets to generate unique resources
- Design concept of: Expensive Infrastructure, Cheap Resources
- Add other biological sources for industry (might wait for spoilage before continuing here)
    - Algae
    - Creatures
    - Fish
    - Fungi
    - Insects/Bugs
    - Mosses
- Separated tech-tree including science packs for different disciplines.
- Beacon-like buildings to boost production for certain buildings. Similar to PyAlienLife but as a separate building.
- Balanced production values
- Art made in Blender instead of MS Paint
